# HackerX Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to write a basic [web crawler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) and [web scraper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) that can save results to a flat (txt, csv, etc.) file.

The target web site doesn't really matter, but you should select a site that contains a search function, and has paged results.

You will have to crawl these pages and scrape the results; which you will then 

That's it.

For example, you could crawl a used car site and collect the summary details of each listing, then store those results as json to file.
